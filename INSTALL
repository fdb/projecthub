ProjectHub has the following dependencies:

* Django: http://www.djangoproject.org/
* PIL (Python Imaging Library): http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

Configuring the project settings
================================
All settings for your installation need to be in a file called
settings_local.py. This file does not exist yet, but you can start by copying
settings_local_example.py and changing what you like. Here, you can specify
the site information, a database (MySQL only), and the primary navigation
links.

Creating the databse
====================
We use dmigrations to maintain our database. So, to initialize, run:

./manage.py dmigrate all

Run the following command to create a superuser, used for logging in to the
admin:
./manage.py createsuperuser


Running the test server

Run the following command to start a test server on port 8000:
./manage.py runserver


Creating the site object
========================
Log in to the admin (http://wwww.example.com/admin/) and add a Site object. For both the domain name and display name, enter the URL of your website.

Creating the homepage

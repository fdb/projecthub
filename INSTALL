Dependencies
============

The Gravital website has the following dependencies:

* typogrify
* template_utils
* dmigrations
* smartypants

All these are already in the "vendor" folder, and settings.py adds this folder
to the sys.path, so you should be all set.

We use dmigrations to maintain our database. So, to initialize, run:

./manage.py dmigrate all


Adding the superuser
====================

./manage.py createsuperuser

ProjectHub is written mainly by Frederik De Bleser.

ProjectHub is a Django website. This project would not be possible without the terrific work of the Django maintainers.

In addition to core Django, we use the following libraries:

* typogrify: http://code.google.com/p/typogrify/
* template_utils: http://code.google.com/p/django-template-utils/
* dmigrations: http://code.google.com/p/dmigrations/
* smartypants: http://web.chad.org/projects/smartypants.py/
